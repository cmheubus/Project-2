# Introduction

*You should have an introduction section that describes the data, the purpose of your analysis, and the
methods you’ll use (roughly - more detail can be given later in the document).*

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Data 
*You should briefly describe the data and the variables you have to work with (no need to discuss all of them,
just the ones you want to use).
You should randomly sample from (say using sample()) the (Monday) data in order to form a training (70%
of the data) and test set (30% of the data). You should set the seed to make your work reproducible.*

39645 observations
```{r Read in Dataset}

```

# Summarizations
*You should produce some basic (but meaningful) summary statistics about the training data you are working
with. The GENERAL things that the plots describe should be explained but, since we are going to automate
things, there is no need to try and explain particular trends in the plots you see (unless you want to try and
automate that too!).*

# Modeling
*You should fit two types of models to predict the shares. One model should be an ensemble model (bagged
trees, random forests, or boosted trees) and one should be a linear regression model (or collection of them
that you’ll choose from).*

*The article referenced in the UCI website mentions that they made the problem into a binary classification
problem by dividing the shares into two groups (< 1400 and >=1400), you can do this if you’d like or simply
try to predict the shares themselves.

Feel free to use code similar to the notes or use the caret package.

After training/tuning your two types of models (linear and non-linear) using cross-validation, AIC, or your
preferred method (all on the training data set only!) you should then compare them on the test set. Your
methodology for choosing your model during the training phase should be explained.* 

# Automation
*Once you’ve completed the above for Monday, adapt the code so that you can use a parameter in your build
process that will cycle through the weekday_is_* variables.*
*... adding a loop?*
